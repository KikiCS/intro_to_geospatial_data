# Introduction to geospatial data
Notebook and demo files to learn the basics of CRS (coordinate reference system), and the libraries `geopandas`, `rasterio` and `xarray`.
These come from the daily tasks we perform at [eoliann-dev](https://github.com/eoliann-dev).

Demo data comes from:
- [Lombardia open data](https://www.geoportale.regione.lombardia.it/download-pacchetti?p_p_id=dwnpackageportlet_WAR_gptdownloadportlet&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_dwnpackageportlet_WAR_gptdownloadportlet_metadataid=r_lombar%3A3417cfea-5192-467e-a388-947bdd7a85f2&_jsfBridgeRedirect=true)
- [Unidata netCDF files](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/examples/files.html)

The notebook in this repo was used to prepare the slides shown during my lesson on September 19th, held for students of [ProfessionAI](https://profession.ai/) courses.
